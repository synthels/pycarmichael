**Definition** (Carmichael number)
A composite number $n$ is a Carmichael number iff $b^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod n$ for all integers $b$ which are relatively prime to $n$. An equivalent and arguably better to work with definition is given by [Korselt's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael_number#Korselt's_criterion).
